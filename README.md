# UTM-Hall-Booking
The UTM Hall Booking System simplifies the process of reserving halls for events
inside the UTM campus. The system oﬀers users access to various information about
available halls, including their locations and capacities aiding in informed
decision-making. Users can check the real-time availability of their chosen halls
through the booking system ensuring eﬃcient planning of their events.
The project is implemented in C++ and incorporates various classes to represent
diﬀerent entities and their relationships enhancing the system's organization and
eﬃciency.
